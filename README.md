# Food Flex: Android Edition
Android App for Food Flex
This is just an idea I'm flirting with...

## Why though?

I love the idea of Food FLex, and I think it could reach a wider audience in a different and interesting way. It wouldn't be the same as the discord server. That's its own unique thing. This is different.

### Submissions
- 3 photos max (not editable after submission - but can delete without resubmit)
- Title (editable after submission)
- Description (editable after submission)


### Voting
A RecyclerView displaying the images. Each element will contain the following views:
- ImageView as background (200dp height)
- Title on top

When a user presses a photo, it opens a new activity that shows the 3 photos, title and description. It also contains a vote button.

_Key difference: submissions will be anonymous_

### Results
Simply a ListView or RecyclerView to show the results. Will probably be inside a Tabbed design so you can see the daily results and overall results next to eachother. 

### Other
Settings will allow people to change their food flex competition length by weeks. Competition starts on a Monday (maybe changable?)


### Misc
- Food chat is dying for now..... (that's difficult)
- Kitchens will exist!
- This might be rewritten in Flutter if it doesn't use too many APIs that Android uses.
